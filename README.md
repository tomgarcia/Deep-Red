Deep Red
========

Deep Red is a machine learning program for playing
[Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_%28card_game%29),
a popular card game with secret rules. Deep Red works by
using classification trees to predict whether a certain move
is valid, and if it is valid, which actions to take. Deep Red
does not yet understand order of play, so it must be told when
to play a card. To play against Deep Red, run main.py; to test
the accuracy of the current model on some sample rules, run
test.py.
